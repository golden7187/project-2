Deploying Machine Learning Web App using Streamlit 
Project Name: multiple disease Prediction web App

Disease Prediction App

1. Description

The Disease Prediction App is a powerful web application that uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of three different diseases: diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. It is built with Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating interactive web applications, and the machine learning models are trained using various datasets related to each disease.

The main goal of this project is to provide users with a user-friendly interface to input their health-related data and receive predictions about their risk of developing these diseases. The app leverages the power of machine learning to analyze the input data and make predictions based on the trained models.

2. Features

Predict diabetes risk: Users can input their relevant health parameters like age, BMI, glucose levels, etc., and get a prediction for their risk of diabetes.
Predict heart disease risk: Users can provide their health data, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc., and receive a prediction for their risk of heart disease.
Predict Parkinson's disease risk: Users can input specific health metrics related to Parkinson's disease and get a prediction for their risk of developing it.

3. Demo

4. Usage

Open the Disease Prediction App in your web browser.

Select the disease you want to predict (diabetes, heart disease, or Parkinson's disease).

Input your relevant health parameters in the provided form.

Click the "Predict" button to receive your disease risk prediction.

5. Model Information
   
The diabetes prediction model is trained on a dataset containing health data of individuals, including features like age, BMI, glucose levels, etc.

The heart disease prediction model is trained on a dataset with various health parameters, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.

The Parkinson's disease prediction model is trained on a dataset consisting of specific health metrics related to Parkinson's disease.
